message =  "Instructions \n \n The goal of this game is to build a well-connected road system to pick \n up commuters when they spawn and drop them off at their destination (indicated by a blinking flag). \n \n If you take too long to pick up and drop off a passenger, they'll get angrier, \n causing the total city's happiness level (green bar) to decrease. \n \n Once the green bar runs out, your city descends into anarchy and you lose. \n \n Passengers will explode and destroy your road network if they get too angry. \n \n Toggle road placement mode by pressing the space bar. \n \n Trees will be placed at grid cells in which you cannot place roads. \n \n Commuters will also spawn as your network becomes more complex, \n which will block you, so plan your roads strategically. \n \n You gain points the longer your city lasts and the more passengers you pick up and drop off. \n \n Thanks for playing! - Shavina Chau, Julian Hernandez, Daniel Dangond, Deng Pan, Charlie Tonneslan";
